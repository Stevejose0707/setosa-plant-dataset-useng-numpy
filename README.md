This script processes the Iris dataset using NumPy, focusing on data loading, transformation, and species-specific analysis.

🔹 Key Operations:
1️⃣ Load the Dataset

Retrieves data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Uses np.genfromtxt() to read the dataset.
2️⃣ Handle Missing Values

Converts NaN values to 0 using np.nan_to_num().
3️⃣ Categorize Petal Sizes

Assigns petal sizes as "small", "medium", or "large" based on petal length.
4️⃣ Find Second Longest Petal Length for Iris-Setosa

Extracts petal length for Iris-setosa.
Sorts in descending order and selects the second longest value.
🚀 Insights:
✅ Efficiently processes Iris dataset using NumPy.
✅ Categorizes petal sizes for quick analysis.
✅ Finds second longest petal length for Iris-setosa.
